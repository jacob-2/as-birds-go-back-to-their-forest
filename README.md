# Max Live Code

Simple, purpose-built web server and frontend allowing live code performances or code sharing and allowing message-sending to [Max 8](https://cycling74.com/products/max-features). In part, it is specialized for the performance of Yunze Mu's _As Birds Go Back to Their Forest_ (see below).

## Usage

`go run .`

"View" page available at `[address]:8090/view/`

"Editor" page download available at `[address]:8090/editor/` &ndash; Unzip and open `editor/editor.html` (Implementation note: this is required in order to connect to Max 8 running on the user's localhost)

## Development

Frontend should be re-written if it grows any larger.
